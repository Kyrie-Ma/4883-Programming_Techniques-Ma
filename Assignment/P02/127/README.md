### The first main1.cpp is the solution I did for cs2 class homework,I got the same output as debug did when I create some infile and put it into debug. But I don't know what the online judge did not accept it, and I don't know where is the online judge think are wrong of my program, so I will have to redo it in a different way(which is the main2.cpp) later, see I can get it accept by the online judge  :) .
